# Simple Spring boot Challenge

Using the Spring Initializr, I've created a new project with the following attributes:
GroupId: com.ltp
Artifact-Id: painting
Dependencies: Spring Web, and Spring Boot Devtools.

Then I've added an index.html file under the static folder and two paintings of Mona Lisa and Salvator Mundi.
Using the HTML I've:
Create a header element that displays: "Da Vinci Artwork".
Create another image element that displays the Mona Lisa.
Create an image element that displays the Salvator Mundi.
Using inline css I gave each painting a width of 200.
Then using the HTML inline css, placed each painting in a block-level container.

Using the HTML <p></p> tag, displayed the following text under each image:
The Salvator Mundi was painted for King Louis XII of France
The Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci.
Using the HTML cheat sheet, place the text inside an inline element.
